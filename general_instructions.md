- **Simulation/Game Environment:** The racing game running on a Windows EC2 spot instance (e.g., g5.xlarge) that outputs telemetry data (speed, acceleration, braking, steering, and current track position).
- **Telemetry Ingestion Layer:** A module to collect real-time telemetry data from the game.
- **RL Environment:** A custom OpenAI Gym (or similar) environment that wraps around your game simulation.
- **RL Agent:** Your “CrossQ” model, a reinforcement learning agent (based on Q-learning or a variant thereof) that takes telemetry inputs and outputs actions.
- **Training Infrastructure:** 
  - **Initial Training:** Run on Sam’s 4080 for heavy compute training.
  - **Deployment/Online Training:** Run on your Windows EC2 spot instance, with the game and training co-located.
- **Reward System:** A reward function that encourages “good” behavior such as staying on a pre-set trajectory, smooth acceleration/braking, etc.


- **State Inputs:** Telemetry data (speed, acceleration, braking, steering, track position).
- **Action Outputs:** Commands for acceleration, braking, and steering.
- **Reward Function:** Design rewards to encourage staying on track and smooth driving.






- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch (or TensorFlow, if preferred)
- **RL Framework:** OpenAI Gym (for environment) plus RL libraries such as Stable Baselines3 or custom implementations.
- **Telemetry Data Collection:** Libraries to interface with the game (could be via sockets, shared memory, or a custom plugin/APIs provided by the game).


- **Local Development:** Set up a local virtual environment, use Git for version control.
- **Cloud Instance Prep:** 
  - Spin up a Windows EC2 instance (g5.xlarge).
  - Ensure you can run the game and Python training scripts concurrently.
  - Set up remote access (RDP/SSH as appropriate) and install dependencies.






- **In-Game Plugin/Module:** Create (or integrate) a module within the sim racing game to stream telemetry data. This might be an API, socket connection, or file-based logging system.
- **Data Format:** Standardize the telemetry output (e.g., JSON messages with fields: speed, acceleration, braking, steering, track position).
  

- Write a Python module that:
  - Connects to the telemetry source.
  - Reads data in real time.
  - Optionally preprocesses data (normalization, filtering).
  
*Example Code Snippet:*
```python
import json
import socket

def telemetry_stream(host='localhost', port=5000):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect((host, port))
    buffer = ""
    while True:
        data = sock.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
        if not data:
            break
        buffer += data
        while "\n" in buffer:
            line, buffer = buffer.split("\n", 1)
            try:
                telemetry = json.loads(line)
                yield telemetry
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue
```






- **Observation Space:** Define using telemetry values (e.g., `Box(low=..., high=...)` in Gym) for speed, acceleration, etc.
- **Action Space:** Define a discrete or continuous space corresponding to steering, braking, and acceleration commands.
- **Reward Function:** 
  - High reward when staying close to a manually set “ideal” trajectory.
  - Penalize deviations, excessive braking/acceleration, or leaving track boundaries.


Create a new Python class inheriting from `gym.Env`.

*Example Code Skeleton:*
```python
import gym
from gym import spaces
import numpy as np

class SimRacingEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimRacingEnv, self).__init__()
        
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=(5,), dtype=np.float32)
        
        self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=-1.0, high=1.0, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32)
        
        self.ideal_trajectory = self.load_ideal_trajectory()

    def load_ideal_trajectory(self):
        
        return np.array([])

    def reset(self):
        
        
        observation = self.get_initial_observation()
        return observation

    def step(self, action):
        
        self.send_action_to_game(action)
        observation = self.get_telemetry_observation()
        reward = self.compute_reward(observation, action)
        done = self.check_done(observation)
        info = {}
        return observation, reward, done, info

    def send_action_to_game(self, action):
        
        pass

    def get_initial_observation(self):
        
        return np.zeros(5)

    def get_telemetry_observation(self):
        
        return np.zeros(5)

    def compute_reward(self, observation, action):
        
        
        reward = 0.0
        
        return reward

    def check_done(self, observation):
        
        return False
```






- If “CrossQ” is a variant of Q-learning, outline how you will handle the Q-function approximation. This might involve using a neural network to approximate the Q-values for each state-action pair.
- Alternatively, if it’s a hybrid approach (e.g., combining model-based and model-free elements), define those components.


- **Model Architecture:** Create a neural network in PyTorch to estimate Q-values.
- **Training Algorithm:** Implement the RL update rules (experience replay, target networks if needed).
- **Reward Shaping:** Integrate your custom reward function into the training loop.

*Example Code Outline:*
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CrossQNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(CrossQNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, output_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


input_dim = 5  
output_dim = 3  
q_network = CrossQNetwork(input_dim, output_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_network.parameters(), lr=1e-4)


```


- **Data Collection:** Run episodes in your custom environment.
- **Experience Replay Buffer:** Store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) to sample mini-batches.
- **Target Network (if applicable):** Stabilize training with a slowly updated target network.
- **Loss Function:** Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted Q-values and target Q-values.

*Pseudocode for the training loop:*
```python
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()
        else:
            state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
            action = q_network(state_tensor).detach().numpy()[0]
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        replay_buffer.add(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
        
        
        batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
        loss = compute_loss(batch, q_network, target_network)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
    
```






- **Packaging:** Package your Python code and dependencies (using a virtual environment or Docker container) for deployment on your Windows EC2 instance.
- **Instance Setup:** Install the necessary libraries (Python, PyTorch, etc.) on the EC2 instance.
- **Automation:** Write scripts to start the simulation game and the RL training process simultaneously. Consider using Windows Task Scheduler or a startup script.


- Use logging and visualization tools (e.g., TensorBoard, Weights & Biases) to monitor training performance.
- Ensure you have robust error handling and state-saving (checkpointing the model) in case of EC2 spot instance termination.






- **Simulation Runs:** Test the trained model within the simulation to see if it follows the trajectory and exhibits improved performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Track lap times, deviation from the ideal trajectory, and consistency of actions.
- **Debugging:** Use extensive logging to identify any issues in the telemetry ingestion, environment dynamics, or reward shaping.


- Refine your reward function as you gather more telemetry data.
- Improve the agent architecture or training hyperparameters based on initial performance.
- Consider collecting more data, or using domain randomization if you later want to generalize to multiple tracks/carts.





- **Dynamic Trajectory Learning:** Once the manual ideal trajectory is outgrown, develop methods to automatically infer the “ideal” trajectory from successful laps.
- **Model Generalization:** Extend training to multiple tracks and vehicles.
- **User Interface:** Build a dashboard for visualizing telemetry data, training progress, and real-time model decisions.
- **Safety Mechanisms:** Implement safeguards to ensure that model actions do not cause erratic behavior in the game.
